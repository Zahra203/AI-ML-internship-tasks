# ðŸ“Œ Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) based on historical data using machine learning classification models.  
It involves **data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation**.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
The main objective of this project is to:
- Identify customers who are likely to churn.
- Help businesses take preventive actions to retain customers.
- Build a machine learning model with high accuracy and reliability.
- Evaluate model performance using multiple metrics, not just accuracy.

## ðŸ›  Methodology / Approach
1. **Data Understanding & Exploration**
   - Load dataset and inspect for missing values, data types, and distributions.
   - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features.

3. **Model Building**
   - Create a pipeline with preprocessing and model steps.
   - Use **Logistic Regression** as the base model.
   - Apply **GridSearchCV** for hyperparameter tuning.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Calculate Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
   - Plot and analyze the Confusion Matrix.
   - Interpret results to identify model strengths and weaknesses.

## ðŸ“Š Key Results / Observations
- **Best Model Selected:** Logistic Regression with optimal parameters from GridSearchCV.
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Accuracy: `0.89`
  - Precision: `0.85`
  - Recall: `0.82`
  - F1 Score: `0.83`
  - ROC-AUC: `0.91`
- The confusion matrix showed that the model is balanced in detecting both churn and non-churn cases.
- ROC curve indicated a high separability between the two classes.
- Feature importance analysis revealed that `tenure`, `monthly charges`, and `contract type` are key churn indicators.
