# Task 1 - Iris Dataset Exploration
## Objective
Explore the Iris dataset using Python libraries to understand patterns and visual trends.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Seaborn's built-in Iris dataset
- 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

## Techniques Used
- Data loading and inspection using Pandas
- Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Descriptive statistics and outlier detection

## Key Findings
- Setosa species is easily separable based on petal features
- Petal length and width show the strongest variation between species
- No missing data, clean dataset for classification models
